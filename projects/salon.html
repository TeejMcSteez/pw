        The website above was built for my mothers growing salon business it
        show's clients a simple look into her work as well as providing a
        scheduling page from her Acuity integration.
      </p>

        I have built two version thus far, the one deployed is written and
        compiled with SvelteKit the rebult version is using Next.js. Within it
        being built she was bombarded with online booking appointments
        (automated of course) and flaws in her scheduling policy showed quickly.
        However, after that it has increased client traffic as well as ease of
        use and made a daily task of calling client automated and pain free.
