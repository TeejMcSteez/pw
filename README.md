## Tommy Hall's (TeejMcSteez) Website

- Still trying to decide if I want to implement a blog or not, do people care about my thoughts? And even if they do is my website shitty implementation of file parsing and display better than others? Things to think about
- I want near if not the exact some functionality as my Next site as I was stupid and thought Next was the only way to accomplish this.
- Be creative and have fun, not just my website but what people will see of me over the internet not just about finishing but liking what I have finished.
